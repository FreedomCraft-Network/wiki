# BloodMoon Event

## _➮_ Introduction

A Blood Moon will begin every 8 in game days. They last for the entire night time duration, and players will be targeted by waves and waves of monsters. Players will be personally focused by randomized groupings of custom designed monsters of varying skills and strengths, and all at the same time rather than on a rotation.

To know when the darkest night is coming, it is recommended to check the Bloodmoon tab within /menu. Additionally, if you are on an instance, the Blood Moon countdown will be updated each day and each night leading up to the actual event. Also just ask a friend who is on the main Dungeons survival world!

## _➮_ What to do?

Blood Moons are challenging nocturnal events that are not to be taken lightly. Survival is unlikely, but if you are prepared you might just stand a chance to reap the rewards! Blood Moons will drop more Elite Coins than baseline dungeons, as there are more waves of weaker swarming creatures to provide that reward. Loot drops will also be easier to obtain, and with time more and more custom drops will be added to the Blood Moons.

If you feel as though you are unprepared for the event, or simply wish to not deal with it, we recommend that you jump on a dungeon instance around your level. You can still gain 2x McMMO experience for the duration even though you are not partaking in the event itself.\

If you want to take on the event for maximum benefit, it is recommended that you make an arena out of a blast resistant block type. Enemies will not spawn in the direction that you are looking, so make sure to leave room for them behind you. Ensure that your inventory is emptied of useless items before the event, and be sure to quickly grab all your coins and loot before it gets blasted by powerful minibosses and bosses!
