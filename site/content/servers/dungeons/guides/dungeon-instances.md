# Dungeon Instances

## _➮_ Introduction

When you join the Dungeons RPG Server for the first time you will find yourself in the Commoner Hall at spawn. This region will serve as the hub for all your RPG needs and can always returned to with `/spawn`.

To simply get started running dungeons, use the command `/dungeons`

{% hint style="info" %}
_You can also use /warps or /teleports_ in place of _/dungeons_.
{% endhint %}

## _➮_ What to do?

If you are a novice/beginner Dungeons player, we recommend starting with the "Tutorial" NPC at spawn in the Commoner Hall.&#x20;

If you are veteran/returning Dungeons player, simply use the new _<mark style="color:orange;">`/dungeons`</mark>_ menu to queue up and join your instance. When you are ready to return to the main world or queue up another Dungeon Instance, simply use _<mark style="color:orange;">`/quit`</mark>_ to return to the main Dungeons Survival World.

It should further be noted that [Jobs](economy.md#jobs) and [Quests](economy.md#quests) do not carry over into Dungeon Instances.
