# Land Claiming

Claims are a chunk of land, that prevent other players from breaking, building, slaying mobs or interacting with anything inside the protected region.
{% endhint %}

## _➮ Getting Started_

New players can create up to 2 separate lands and claim a total of 80 chunks. Additional claim chunks are provided for every hour of active playtime and additional Land Ownership Slots are rewarded every 7-days of active playtime automatically.
