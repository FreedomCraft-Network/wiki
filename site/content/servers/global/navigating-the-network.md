# Navigating the Network

## _âž®_ Lobby

The hub is where most new players spawn. The hub is also where players are sent during each server's routine reboots. These reboots typically take a minute or two and you can join the server again shortly.

Straight ahead are NPCs (non-playing characters) you can click to join the game mode of your choice. You are also able to use the Nether Star in your hotbar to open a Navigation GUI.

Hovering over any icon will give basic information about each server and allow you to join. Each game mode is described within this wiki.

You can return to the Lobby at any point or from any server by simply using <mark style="color:orange;">`/hub`</mark>
