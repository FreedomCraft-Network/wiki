# FAQ

**Q: I purchased something in the store but I haven't received it in-game!**\
\
**A:** When you purchase something, it takes a little while for it to update in our store, and send the commands to our servers. It can take up to 5-10 minutes before your purchased content arrives. If it doesn't, get in touch with a staff member and we'll get it to you manually!\




**Q: What payment method can I use to purchase something from the store?**\
\
**A:** We have a variety of payments methods available through our checkout, all of the available options are presented to you when you proceed to checkout. The options that you see available to you are localized based on the country you are in.



**Q: Who do I go to if I need help or if something goes wrong?**\
\
**A:** It's not very likely something goes wrong, but if it does, then get in touch with us on Discord, click [**here**](https://freedomcraftmc.com/discord) link to join!\




**Q: What happens if I chargeback?**\
\
**A:** We take chargeback cases seriously, if you charge back a package, item or service that we offer on our store then you will immediately be banned by our automated web store. Charging back the funds for what you paid for is frowned upon everywhere, your name is added to a global blacklist within the network which in turn can result in you being banned from other stores, servers and purchasing from other games in the future.
