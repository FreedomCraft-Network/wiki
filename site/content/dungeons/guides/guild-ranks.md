## _➮_ How to Rank Up

On the 3rd floor of the Commoner Hall at Spawn, you'll find a Guild Attendant at the top of the stairs. At this NPC you can purchase your next rank and unlock higher tier EliteDrops, allowing you to get better loot and progress to more difficult Dungeons.

Once you have reached the Maximum Guild Rank, you can unlock the Prestige Ranks for additional perks, benefits and **even more** Guild Ranks to be unlocked.
