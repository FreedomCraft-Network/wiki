# Item Stats

**What they are:**\
\
Stats are the essential defining factor for how strong a player is within the Dungeons game mode. They determine how much health, regen, attack damage, and attack speed that the player has. In order to progress, it is necessary to collect gear that has high levels of stats capable of both surviving and clearing Dungeon mobs and bosses!\
\
**What they do:**

Currently, we have four stats:

Strength - Defines attack damage

Dexterity - Defines attack speed

Vitality - Defines health pool

Vigor - Defines health regen, minorly helps increasing max health\
\
**How to get them:**\
\
Strength and Dexterity are obtained through weapons such as Swords, Axes, Tridents, Bows, and Crossbows. They are obtained through the Glove and Ring accessories.\
\
Vitality and Vigor are obtained through armor pieces such as Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, and Boots. They are obtained through the Bracelet and Amulet accessories.\
\
In game, if you click your Stats item next to the four added accessory slots, you can see exactly where your stats are coming from in game.\
\
**Do you have good stats?**\
\
Determining whether an item has good stats is more than just asking about a piece of gear. Simply asking whether your Black Hills Sword is good or not will not get any useful answers. Stats for weapons like the sword follow this pattern:\
\
Strength: \<Actual Str Value>   \[Roll (Distribution Number) x (Percentage Roll)]\
Dexterity: \<Actual Dex Value> \[Roll (Distribution Number) x (Percentage Roll)]\
\
The Actual Value refers to the true stat on the item, and all other numbers are there to explain how the item got that stat value. The Distribution Number refers to the overall distribution of the item and whether it is weighted more toward Strength or Dexterity. The Percentage Roll determines the overall quality of the item, with a higher number up to 100% being superior to any lower number going down to 0%.
