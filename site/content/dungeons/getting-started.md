# Getting Started

## _➮_ Introduction

FreedomCraft Dungeons Gamemode is a Survival-Like RPG Gamemode with seemingly never-ending progression and rewards.&#x20;

When you join the Dungeons Server for the first time you will find yourself in the Commoner Hall at spawn. This region will serve as the hub for all your RPG needs and can always returned to with <mark style="color:orange;">`/spawn`</mark>.

## _➮_ What to do?

If you are a novice/beginner Dungeons player, we recommend starting with the "Tutorial" NPC at spawn in the Commoner Hall.

Once you've established a base with resources and some farms to keep yourself fed, begin conquering our wide range of Dungeons to Level Up, Unlock Rewards and progress your way to the top of the leaderboards.
