# Navigating the Network

## _➮_ Lobby

The hub is where most new players spawn. The hub is also where players are sent during each server's routine reboots. These reboots typically take a minute or two and you can join the server again shortly.

Straight ahead are NPCs (non-playing characters) you can click to join the game mode of your choice. You are also able to use the Nether Star in your hot bar to open a Navigation GUI.

Hovering over any icon will give basic information about each server and allow you to join. Each game mode is described within this wiki.

> [!tip] You can return to the Lobby at any point or from any server by simply using `/hub`
